### 🪙 rUv Token Economics

**Resource Utilization Vouchers (rUv)** are the native tokens for computational resource trading:

- **Purpose**: Facilitate trustless exchange of computational resources between agents
- **Quantum Security**: All transfers protected with ML-DSA signatures
- **Precision**: 64-bit integer precision for micro-transactions
- **Supply**: Configurable maximum supply with mint/burn operations
- **Integration**: Native support in QuDAG DAG consensus system

#### Token Operations
```bash
# Create account and manage tokens
qudag exchange create-account --name alice
qudag exchange balance --account alice
qudag exchange transfer --from alice --to bob --amount 1000
qudag exchange mint --account alice --amount 5000
qudag exchange supply
```

### 📊 Dynamic Tiered Fee Model

The exchange implements a sophisticated mathematical fee model that incentivizes agent verification and rewards high-usage participants:

#### Fee Structure

| Agent Type | Base Fee | Maximum Fee | Usage Behavior |
|------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Unverified** | 0.1% | 1.0% | Increases with time and usage |
| **Verified** | 0.25% | 0.50% → 0.25% | Decreases with high usage |

#### Mathematical Formulation

**Unverified Agent Fee:**
```
f_unv(u,t) = F_min + (F_max - F_min) × α(t) × β(u)
where:
α(t) = 1 - e^(-t/T)     # Time phase-in (3 months)
β(u) = 1 - e^(-u/U)     # Usage scaling (10,000 rUv threshold)
```

**Verified Agent Fee:**
```
f_ver(u,t) = F_min_ver + (F_max_ver - F_min_ver) × α(t) × (1 - β(u))
# Rewards high usage with lower fees
```

#### Fee Examples

| Scenario | Time | Usage | Fee Rate | Description |
|----------|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| New unverified agent | 0 months | 0 rUv/month | 0.100% | Introductory rate |
| Moderate unverified | 3 months | 5,000 rUv/month | 0.324% | Standard progression |
| High-usage unverified | 6 months | 50,000 rUv/month | 0.873% | Penalty for unverified high usage |
| New verified agent | 0 months | 0 rUv/month | 0.250% | Verified base rate |
| High-usage verified | 6 months | 20,000 rUv/month | 0.279% | Reward for verified high usage |

#### Configure Fee Parameters
```bash
# Update fee model parameters
qudag exchange configure-fees \
  --f-min 0.002 \
  --f-max 0.012 \
  --f-min-verified 0.003 \
  --f-max-verified 0.006 \
  --time-constant-days 90 \
  --usage-threshold 10000

# View current fee status and examples
qudag exchange fee-status --examples

# Calculate specific fees
qudag exchange calculate-fee --account alice --amount 1000
```

### 🔒 Immutable Deployment System

The exchange supports optional immutable deployment mode for governance-free operation:

#### Security Features

- **Quantum-Resistant Signatures**: ML-DSA-87 signatures lock configurations
- **Configuration Hashing**: Blake3 hashes ensure integrity
- **Grace Period**: Configurable grace period before enforcement (default 24 hours)
- **Emergency Override**: Optional governance keys for emergency situations
- **Atomic Locking**: All-or-nothing configuration locking

#### Deployment Workflow

```bash
# 1. Configure the exchange
qudag exchange configure-fees --f-min 0.001 --f-max 0.01

# 2. Deploy in immutable mode with 1-hour grace period
qudag exchange deploy-immutable --grace-period 1

# 3. Check deployment status
qudag exchange immutable-status

# During grace period (1 hour):
# - Configuration can still be modified
# - System shows "locked but not enforced"

# After grace period:
# - All configuration changes blocked
# - System operates in governance-free mode
```

#### Status Monitoring
```bash
# Detailed immutable deployment status
qudag exchange immutable-status --format json
```

Example output:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "locked": true,
  "enforced": true,
  "in_grace_period": false,
  "locked_at": "2025-06-22T15:30:00Z",
  "grace_period_seconds": 3600,
  "config_hash": "blake3:a1b2c3d4..."
}
```

### 🤖 Agent Verification System

Agents can be verified to receive reduced fees and enhanced privileges:

#### Verification Benefits

- **Lower Fees**: Reduced base fees (0.25% vs 0.1%)
- **Usage Rewards**: High usage decreases fees further
- **Priority Access**: Enhanced access to network resources
- **Trust Signals**: Cryptographic proof of verification status

#### Verification Process

```bash
# 1. Create verification proof file
cat > agent_proof.json << EOF
{
  "agent_id": "alice",
  "verification_type": "kyc_document",
  "proof_hash": "blake3:verification_data_hash",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-22T15:30:00Z",
  "signature": "ml_dsa_signature_bytes"
}
EOF

# 2. Submit verification
qudag exchange verify-agent \
  --account alice \
  --proof-path agent_proof.json

# 3. Update usage statistics for better rates
qudag exchange update-usage \
  --account alice \
  --usage 15000

# 4. Calculate fees with verified status
qudag exchange calculate-fee \
  --account alice \
  --amount 1000
```

```

## How It Works

### DAG Architecture
```
     Message C ────┐
    ╱              ▼
Message A ───► [DAG Vertex] ◄─── Message D
    ╲              ▲
     Message B ────┘
     
Each vertex contains:
- ML-KEM encrypted payload
- Parent vertex references  
- ML-DSA signatures
- Consensus metadata
```

### Core Components
- **DAG Consensus**: QR-Avalanche algorithm for Byzantine fault tolerance
- **Vertex Processing**: Parallel message validation and ordering
- **Quantum Cryptography**: ML-KEM-768 encryption + ML-DSA signatures
- **P2P Network**: LibP2P mesh with Kademlia DHT discovery
- **Anonymous Routing**: Multi-hop onion routing through the DAG

### Message Processing Flow
1. **Message Creation**: Encrypt with ML-KEM-768, sign with ML-DSA
2. **DAG Insertion**: Create vertex with parent references
3. **Consensus**: QR-Avalanche validation across network
4. **Propagation**: Distribute through P2P mesh network
5. **Finalization**: Achieve consensus finality in DAG structure
